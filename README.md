# Asset Management Console Application

## Overview

This console application allows a company to manage its assets, such as phones and computers. Users can add assets with details like purchase date, brand, model, price, and country of origin. The program also checks if the asset has passed certain age thresholds. All user inputs are validated before being added to the system.

This project is part of a C# course assignment, focusing on practicing the use of try/catch blocks, DateTime, class structures, abstract classes, and more.

## Features
